Title: As a user, I should see the rating of each book in the bookstore list

Description: A lot of the users have said that there's no clear way to distinguish the quality of the books in our portal. We should have a rating feature or something similar to that to allow users to quickly pick up most highest rated books from the other users.

Alternatives considered Support review submissions. Initially it should be sufficient if we allow users to just provide a rating between one and five stars.
